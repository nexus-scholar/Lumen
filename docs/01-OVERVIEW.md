# Lumen: Project Vision & Overview

## Vision
Lumen is an AI-powered systematic review platform aiming to cut review time from six months to two weeks, while guaranteeing PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S 2021 compliance, scholarly quality, and research transparency.

## Mission
Illuminate the research process for academics by automating literature scoping, screening, data extraction, and reporting—so systematic reviews become fast, accurate, and universally accessible.

## Why Now?
- PRISMA compliance standards are more demanding than ever
- Existing tools are costly, slow, and rarely built by researchers
- Open scholarly datasets (OpenAlex, Crossref, arXiv) make automation feasible
- LLMs allow powerful protocol reasoning and synthesis but need guardrails for trust

## Competitive Landscape
- Covidence, Rayyan: Limited automation, expensive, web-only
- DistillerSR: Enterprise focus, steep pricing
- Review software neglects versioning, offline capability, or PRISMA-S search reporting
- Lumen: Combines the best, adds anti-hallucination queries, Git versioning, and AI analytics

## Brand Philosophy
Lumen means “light”—bringing clarity and transparency to evidence synthesis.
