# Stage 14: Synthesis & Analytics

**Purpose:** LLM-powered narrative synthesis and graph analytics.

## Features

### 1. Narrative Synthesis
- LLM generates 400-600 word summaries
- Identifies contradictions across studies
- Highlights research gaps

### 2. Citation Network Analysis
- Force-directed graph visualization
- Community detection (Louvain algorithm)
- Influential paper identification

### 3. Meta-Analysis Integration
- Export data for R/RevMan
- Forest plots, funnel plots

## Implementation

Uses JGraphT for graph algorithms, LLM for synthesis.

See full implementation in repo.
